# N-bit-Carry-Lookahead-Adder
Carry Lookahead adder requires fulladder logic module.

▪ A Carry lookahead Adder is made of a number of full adders cascaded together.  
▪ Carry lookahead adder is similar to ripple carry adder with the difference that it calculates the 
carry bit before the full adder is done with its operation. 
▪ Advantage of carry lookahead adders is that it adds two numbers faster than ripple carry adder 
▪ The drawback is that carry lookahead adder takes more logic.  
▪ For faster performance when adding two number select carry lookahead adder implementation 
and for more lower resource usage select ripple carry adder implementation 
▪ The figure below shows 4 full-adders connected together to produce a 4-bit lookahead carry 
adder.
